# BESS for hydrogen production
A French hydrogen producer is seeking to define the optimal sizing for its energy storage solution (BESS) before committing to a significant financial investment. The goal is to take advantage of energy market volatility to adjust and optimize its production costs.
The objective of the project is to build a model that determines the optimal sizing of an energy storage asset based on specific input parameters (e.g., location, plant size, percentage of exposure to the energy market, etc.). To achieve this, the main activities will be as follows:

**Simulation model**

* Simulate the operation of the hydrogen production plant and its associated energy demand
* Optimize the operation of the energy storage asset
* Simulate the combined operation of the (plant + storage) system over a given period to optimize the sizing of the storage asset

A **visual interface** will allow users to input parameters and optional settings, run the model, and interpret the model’s results.
